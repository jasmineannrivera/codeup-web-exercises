	<h3>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.</h3>
	<p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. You are only limited by your imagination. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. All kinds of happy little splashes.

		We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Let your imagination be your guide. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.

		I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Work that paint. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.

<!-- About My Work -->
<div id="work" class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">
	<h3 class="margin">About My Work</h3>
	<p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Just make a decision and let it go. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.

		Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. We'll make some happy little bushes here. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

		If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. This is the fun part This is truly an almighty mountain. Every time you practice, you learn more. This is unplanned it really just happens. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.
