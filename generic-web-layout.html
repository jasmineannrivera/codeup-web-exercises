				<p>Fun time! Now we wash the ol' brush! It's the contrast in this painting that makes it so pretty. That's the most fun of all. You're limited only by your imagination. Let's build us a mountain! All you need is a dream in your heart. There's some little stringy ones that live down here. A flock of trees? I don't know... a STAND of trees. That's what you call them! Just let it sorta dance around in the sky. Drop in some happy little shadows.</p>

				<p>You learn to take advantage of whatever happens and use it to make your painting special. Let's do a winter scene, what the heck. (chuckles) Just beat the devil out of it. Take your time and play with these things. You can do all this blending without becoming a mud-mixer. That's the most fun of all. Get tough with it. We'll start playing a little bit. We'll make those decisions later. You know me -- I like water.</p>

				<p>This is such a super day! It's time we got strong here. It's bad when you have to tie a bucket on the side of your painting. Let's do another one -- what the heck! I want a very gentle, quiet little sky. Just make little criss-cross strokes. We'll just have a firecracker of a sky up here. It's a fantastic day here, and I hope it is wherever you're at. At some point in between, you have to reach a happy medium. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>
