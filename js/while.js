    // An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. Write a JS program that generates a random number between 50 and 100 representing the amount of cones to sell. Your code should generate numbers between 1 and 5, simulating the amount of cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the console the amount of cones sold to each person. This is how you get the random numbers.
